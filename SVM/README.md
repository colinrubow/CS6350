svm.py has two functions. One is for training and testing an SVM model. The other is for testing an SVM model.
The training and testing data has each examples in rows.
The last column is the classification of the example as either -1 or 1. The first column should be all 1's. Each of the three functions will output the learned perceptron weighted vector and if testing data is given to the function, it will also return the test error for each epoch.
